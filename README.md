# Audio Injector Analogue Breakout Standard (AI-ABS) v1

## What is it ?

The AI-ABS is a standard intended to give analogue breakout boards
a standard form factor so they may be used interchangeably between
sound cards.

## Why do we need it ?

If you implement an analogue preamplifier or other electrical system of
some kind, it would be great to be able to use it with more then one
product.

This would ensure a certain level of future compatability between
products.
